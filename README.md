# Help System and User Instructions
Ace Master is a blackjack game where players compete against the dealer. The goal is to score as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The game is played with virtual money, and the following actions are available:

1. **Place a Bet**: Use the betting buttons to select your wager before the cards are dealt.
2. **Hit**: Draw another card to try and get closer to 21.
3. **Stand**: End your turn and let the dealer play.
4. **Balance Refill**: Refill your virtual balance if it runs out.
5. **Win/Loss**: The game calculates your score and announces whether you win, lose, or tie with the dealer.
6. **Table Color Switching**: Customize the look of your blackjack table by switching between different color themes in the settings menu.

The interface is simple, with buttons for all major actions and a visual tracker for your balance and scores.
